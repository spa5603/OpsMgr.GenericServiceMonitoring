## OpsMgr GenericServiceMonitoring ManagementPack

## Introduction:
It is often necessary to monitor windows services across your entire SCOM environment. This Management Pack gives you the ability to easily and quickly discover and monitor hundreds of services. The wildcard(*) notation allows great flexibility in discovering the services you are looking for.

This Management Pack is currently under development and may contain errors. Please always test it in DEV environment befor importing the Management Pack to production.

## Key Features

- wildcard(*) notation for servicenames
- one configuration for the entire management group

## Supported Environments

- System Center Operations Manager 2012 R2
- System Center Operations Manager Long Term Servicing Channel (2016)
- System Center Operations Manager Semi-Annual Channel (1807)
- PowerShell 3.0 is a minimal requirement for the agents on which the requested services should be monitored

## How-To:
### 1. Import the Management Pack into SCOM.
### 2. Create the CSV file on one of your management server. 

   #### CSV file schema:

   __ServiceName;Include;Exclude__

    Include: comma-separated list of servernames (ShortName; not FQDN)

    Exclude: comma-separated list of servernames (ShortName; not FQDN)

    *: Every host in the "Microsoft.SystemCenter.ManagedComputerServer" class
    
   #### CSV file examples:
   
   __ServiceA;HostA,HostB;none__

    serviceA is monitored for hostA and hostB. There is no (none) exclusion.

  __ServiceB;*;none__

    serviceB is monitored on every host. There is no (none) exclusion.

  __Service*;*;HostB__

    service*(wildcard) is monitored on every host and excluded for hostB.


### 3. Start service ingestion task

   1. The task which starts the CSV ingestion process is found at the "Management Server View". Select the management server on which the CSV is located and execute the task. (example at Views -> State View Management Server)
   2. Click "Override" to enter the path to the CSV.

### 4. Check discoverd services
The discovery is configured to run every 24h and detect newly processed services. This setting can be changed at the xml code to meet your requirements. So it can take up to 24 hours until the service can be discovered.

#### XML tag:
      <DataSource ID="DS" TypeID="Windows!Microsoft.Windows.TimedPowerShell.DiscoveryProvider">
 >      <IntervalSeconds>86400</IntervalSeconds>
       <SyncTime></SyncTime>
       <ScriptName>OpsMgr.GenericServiceMonitoring.Scripts.GetServicesToMonitor.Script.ps1</ScriptName>


### 5. In case of an error
Important events (such as errors or discovered services) are logged in the Operatiosn Manager Log on the management server as well as on the agent. They can be found at event id 5603.

There is also an alarm rule that comes up when a service should be discovered but he does not exist on the server.
